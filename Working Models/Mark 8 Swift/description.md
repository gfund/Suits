Discord Bot based on Iron Man Mark XLVI and previous bot "suits" of mine
Some of its features include:
* messaging people similar to a phone call 
* muting people 
* searching for a user given their profile picture

It is an improvement on Mark 7 Lightning that was more based on my PC which isn't what I needed in a suit but it allowed for more libraries.
A lot of Lightning was copied over but some improvements and new features were introduced.
