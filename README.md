# The Suit Archive

This repository contains every experimental bot and "suit" Discord Bot I’ve built over the years and will be periodically updated if I find anymore worthwhile showpieces.  
Think of it as a museum of prototypes — some polished, some broken, all part of the journey.  

Each version reflects a stage of learning, tinkering, and upgrading. Some boot lightning-fast, some glitch like Starboost, but every one carries a story.  

Use Code at Your Own Risk. If you don't know what it does **Don't touch it**, Yes *you*!(Go Ask ChatGPT or Grok)
